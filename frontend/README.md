### Milestone 23: Select Address Page & Order Schema

In this milestone, we have implemented the "Select Address" page in the frontend and written the product schema for orders in the backend. This enhances the user experience by allowing users to choose a delivery address before placing an order.


#### Key Tasks:
- Add a "Place Order" button inside the cart page.
- Implement a "Select Address" page displaying all saved addresses.
- Create a backend endpoint to fetch user addresses.
- Design a Mongoose schema to store order details.
