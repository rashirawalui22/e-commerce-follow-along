### Milestone 20: User Profile Page

In this milestone, we will build a frontend profile page to display user data and create a backend endpoint to retrieve that data.

#### Key Tasks:
- Create a backend endpoint to send user data using their email.
- Design a frontend profile page to display the user’s profile photo, name, email, and addresses.
- Add a section for addresses with an “Add Address” button, and display “No address found” if no address exists.

This milestone enhances the user experience by providing a profile page to view and manage their information.
