Milestone 29📝
Created a PayPal Developer Account and logged into the PayPal Developer Dashboard.

Located the Client ID in the sandbox accounts and saved it in the project.

Updated the Order Confirmation Page to include two payment options:

Cash on Delivery (COD)

Online Payment

Implemented radio buttons to toggle between COD and Online Payment.

Set up logic so that PayPal buttons only appear when the Online Payment option is selected.
